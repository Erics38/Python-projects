# Final Deployment Fixes and Resource Cleanup

## Session Summary

This document records the final resolution steps taken to achieve a successful Terraform infrastructure deployment after completing the comprehensive troubleshooting documented in `TERRAFORM-TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md`.

## Issues Resolved in This Session

### 1. Undeclared Variable Warnings âœ… RESOLVED

**Problem**: Terraform warned about undeclared variables in `demo.tfvars`:
```
Warning: Value for undeclared variable
The root module does not declare a variable named "deployment_maximum_percent"
The root module does not declare a variable named "deployment_minimum_healthy_percent"
```

**Root Cause**: Variables referenced in tfvars files but not declared in variables.tf

**Solution**: Added missing variable declarations to `docker-hello-world/infrastructure/variables.tf`:

```hcl
# ECS Deployment Configuration Variables (for backward compatibility)
variable "deployment_maximum_percent" {
  description = "Maximum percentage of tasks that can be running during deployment"
  type        = number
  default     = 200

  validation {
    condition     = var.deployment_maximum_percent >= 100 && var.deployment_maximum_percent <= 400
    error_message = "Deployment maximum percent must be between 100 and 400."
  }
}

variable "deployment_minimum_healthy_percent" {
  description = "Minimum percentage of healthy tasks during deployment"
  type        = number
  default     = 100

  validation {
    condition     = var.deployment_minimum_healthy_percent >= 0 && var.deployment_minimum_healthy_percent <= 100
    error_message = "Deployment minimum healthy percent must be between 0 and 100."
  }
}
```

### 2. IAM Tag Validation Error âœ… RESOLVED

**Problem**: IAM role creation failed with tag validation error:
```
Error: creating IAM Role: ValidationError: 1 validation error detected: 
Value at 'tags.8.member.value' failed to satisfy constraint: 
Member must satisfy regular expression pattern: [\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*
```

**Root Cause**: IAM tag values cannot contain parentheses - the tag `Purpose = "ECS task execution (infrastructure operations)"` contained invalid characters.

**Solution**: Removed parentheses from IAM tag values in `docker-hello-world/infrastructure/modules/ecs/iam.tf`:

```hcl
# Before:
Purpose = "ECS task execution (infrastructure operations)"

# After:
Purpose = "ECS task execution infrastructure operations"
```

### 3. Resource Conflicts from Previous Failed Deployments âœ… RESOLVED

**Problem**: Multiple AWS resources already existed from previous deployment attempts, causing conflicts:

- `guestbook-demo-db-credentials` (Secrets Manager)
- `guestbook-demo-db-subnet-group` (RDS Subnet Group) 
- `guestbook-demo-alb` (Load Balancer)
- `guestbook-demo-app-tg` (Target Group)
- `/aws/waf/demo-guestbook` (CloudWatch Log Group)
- `/aws/ecs/guestbook-demo-cluster-app` (CloudWatch Log Group)
- `demo-security-headers-lambda-role` (IAM Role)
- Duplicate Security Group rules
- WAF IP sets

**Root Cause**: When Terraform deployments fail partway through, some resources get created but aren't properly tracked in state, causing conflicts on subsequent runs.

**Solution**: Systematic cleanup using AWS CLI commands:

```bash
# Delete Secrets Manager secret
aws secretsmanager delete-secret --secret-id "guestbook-demo-db-credentials" --force-delete-without-recovery --region us-east-1

# Delete RDS subnet group  
aws rds delete-db-subnet-group --db-subnet-group-name "guestbook-demo-db-subnet-group" --region us-east-1

# Delete load balancer
aws elbv2 delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-arn $(aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --names "guestbook-demo-alb" --query "LoadBalancers[0].LoadBalancerArn" --output text --region us-east-1) --region us-east-1

# Delete target group
aws elbv2 delete-target-group --target-group-arn $(aws elbv2 describe-target-groups --names "guestbook-demo-app-tg" --query "TargetGroups[0].TargetGroupArn" --output text --region us-east-1) --region us-east-1

# Delete CloudWatch log groups
aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name "/aws/waf/demo-guestbook" --region us-east-1
aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name "/aws/ecs/guestbook-demo-cluster-app" --region us-east-1

# Delete IAM role (detach policies first)
aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name "demo-security-headers-lambda-role" --policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" --region us-east-1
aws iam delete-role --role-name "demo-security-headers-lambda-role" --region us-east-1
```

## Next Steps for Future Sessions

When resuming work on this project:

1. **Reference Documents**: 
   - `TERRAFORM-TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md` - Complete issue history and solutions
   - `FINAL-DEPLOYMENT-FIXES.md` (this document) - Latest session changes

2. **Deployment Status**: All major blocking issues resolved, infrastructure should deploy successfully

3. **Monitoring**: Check GitHub Actions workflow status at: https://github.com/Erics38/Python-projects/actions

4. **Validation Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Verify no resource conflicts remain
   aws secretsmanager list-secrets --query "SecretList[?contains(Name, 'guestbook-demo')].Name"
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancers[?contains(LoadBalancerName, 'guestbook-demo')]"
   aws rds describe-db-subnet-groups --query "DBSubnetGroups[?contains(DBSubnetGroupName, 'guestbook-demo')]"
   ```

## Professional DevOps Lessons Learned

### Resource Conflict Resolution Strategy
1. **Identify conflicting resources** using AWS CLI queries
2. **Delete in dependency order** (dependent resources first)
3. **Use force-delete options** where appropriate for cleanup
4. **Verify cleanup** before retrying deployment

### IAM Best Practices Reinforced
1. **Tag validation is strict** - avoid special characters like parentheses
2. **Test IAM configurations** in isolation when possible
3. **Use consistent naming patterns** for easier resource management

### Terraform State Management
1. **Partial deployments create orphaned resources** not tracked in state
2. **Manual cleanup is sometimes necessary** when state and reality diverge
3. **Targeted destroy operations** can resolve specific conflicts
